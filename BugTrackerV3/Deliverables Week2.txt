Deliverable Date
Monday, March 20, 2017 (finished April ?, 2017)
*Make the project excellent





Bugs to Address:

Notes: after break make sure admin sees only 1 list in tickets view (low priority)
-Makes "Users on Projects show" in Project/details



****************************
bootstrap notes
-Bootstrap is downloadable in two forms, within which you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common resources and providing both compiled and minified variations.

Containers
Bootstrap requires a containing element to wrap site contents and house our grid system. You may choose one of two containers to use in your projects. Note that, due to padding and more, neither container is nestable.

Use .container for a responsive fixed width container.

<div class="container">
  ...
</div>
Use .container-fluid for a full width container, spanning the entire width of your viewport.

<div class="container-fluid">
  ...
</div>

****
(this should help with portfolio experience/education) sections being different heights with that extra margin issue.

Responsive column resets
With the four tiers of grids available you're bound to run into issues where, at certain breakpoints, your columns don't clear quite right as one is taller than the other. To fix that, use a combination of a .clearfix and our responsive utility classes.

*was adding striped table when I left off.




submitters must be able to create tickets for projects they belong to
If user is on project, then show them add ticket button
If user IS NOT on project, then show them everything BUT the ticket button
Admin/PM adds user to project
User then hits project details and clicks edit button

4/5/18
Decide on 2 -3 elements to use in all views
Projects view (appviews/projects)
Project Details view table details  (appviews)
Standard Table (Tables/datatables)

*All details are in cards (project/tickets and ticket/comments tickets/history should be in homer datatable)
-reduce details shown, if necessary to create concise pages/cards
